This is a simple Rust CLI app. It will get more complicated as we build it out. It will store and run powershell snippets on a windows machine and bash snippets on a linux machine. It's essentially a user friendly wrapper for aliasing. It also handles variable injection for them. Target users are low skill users who want to run slightlymore complex commands without needing to know how to write scripts or use the command line effectively.

The app will be extended with a GUI later, but for now it's just a CLI app. The CLI app will be the backend for the GUI app, and needs to be well structured and modular to allow for easy integration later.
