# GoGoGadget Release Notes

Welcome to GoGoGadget 0.1.1! 🎉

This release introduces our first new feature: the **Analyze** command, along with all the original features that make GoGoGadget easy for everyone.

---

## ✨ What's New in 0.1.1

- **Analyze Command**: Not sure which parts of your PowerShell command should be variables? The new `analyze` command helps you! Just type your command, and GoGoGadget will highlight the parts that are likely to be user input (like file paths, numbers, or strings) and suggest how to turn them into variables. Great for beginners and anyone who wants to make shortcuts faster and safer.

## 🚀 What Can You Do With GoGoGadget?

- **Easy Variables**: Use `{{VARNAME}}` in your commands and GoGoGadget will ask you for the details each time you run them.
- **Add, Edit, and Delete Shortcuts**: Add new shortcuts, edit existing ones, or remove those you don’t need—all with simple prompts.
- **List All Shortcuts**: See all your saved shortcuts with a single command.
- **First-Run Safety Message**: On your first run, GoGoGadget explains that we don't check your scripts for safety and reminds you to be careful with your scripts.
